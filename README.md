## Exercise:
Work in pairs!
​
Refactor your project from Friday by automating some of the tasks associated with it. These should include:
​
- Set up a browser reload using browser sync
- Writing and compiling Sass
- Concatenate all JavaScript files into one, minified file
​
Research a Gulp plugin I haven't mentioned. Use the documentation to add it, implement one of its basic tasks in your gulpfile, and build a small demo of what it does.
